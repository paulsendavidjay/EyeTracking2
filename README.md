EyeTracking code for final analyses


This collection of scripts is particular to one specific data set. Some of the functions in 'scripts/functions' may be useful for other purposes (e.g. reject_outliers.R, cut_repeats.R), but for the most part will not be useful outside of the context for which they were written.
